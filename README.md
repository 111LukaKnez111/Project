# Innovative parking analysis: curbs detection, drone assisted parking insights, and video sign recognition from images

**Description:**

Step into the world of innovation and creativity as we delve into the realm of parking analysis, curb detections, and road safety enhancements. Our project is a fusion of ingenuity, combining a homemade quadcopter, iPhone LiDAR sensor for height maps, and YOLO for curb, sign, and street marks detections.

Embark on an extraordinary journey into curb detection, vehicle positioning, and traffic sign recognition like never before.

**Key Features:**

**LiDAR Curb Detection:** Leverage the power of iPhone LiDAR to visualize curbs in height maps. This revolutionary approach and unique idea transforms curbs into data rich visuals, contributing to better early obstacles detections and strategic parking allocation.

**Quadcopter Parking Checks:** Our custom built quadcopter, integrated with YOLO and QuickHull algorithms, takes us to the skies to assess parking alignment against our rich homemade dataset that is 100% custom. Realtime parking evaluations, precise vehicle placements, and insightful analysis empower optimized parking management.

**Street Sign Detection:** Through our phone camera's lens, we navigate the cityscape, capturing street marks and signs with accuracy. Advanced recognition techniques unveil critical traffic guidelines, that contributes to driver's safety.

Our project is dedicated to crafting safer and more accessible streets for individuals with disabilities, prioritizing their safety and well being. Through innovative technologies and compassionate design, we are providing them with additional data that helps them recognise events on roads faster which leads to faster reaction times and to better safety of all of us in promet.
